# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Promise

Regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, 
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, 
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation, we as members, contributors, and leaders 
commit to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

We promise to behave and engage in ways that support a welcome, inclusive, diverse, and healthy community.

## Our Principles
Examples of conduct that helps our community have a positive atmosphere include:

* Displaying compassion and kindness for others.
* Respecting the ideas, perspectives, and experiences of others.
* Delivering and accepting criticism with grace.
* Assuming responsibility, expressing regret to those impacted by our errors, and taking lessons from the encounter.
* Concentrating on what is best for the entire community, not just for ourselves as individuals.

Unacceptable conduct examples include:

* Using sexualized language or imagery, and/or engaging in sexual
improvements of any type

* Trolls, offensive or disparaging remarks, and political or personal assaults

* Harassment in public or privately

* Making public someone else's private information, such their address or email
address without their express consent

* Additional actions that might be judged unsuitable in a
professional environment

## Enforcement Obligations

Community leaders are in charge of outlining and upholding our standards of acceptable conduct,
and they will respond to any behaviour that they find improper, threatening, disrespectful, or
harmful by taking reasonable corrective action.

Community leaders have the authority and duty to delete, alter, or reject comments, commits,
codes, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not adhere to this Code of Conduct.
When necessary, they will also provide justifications for their actions.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct is applicable in all public areas where the community is represented by 
an official representative, as well as in all other community places. Using a company-issued
email address, publishing on a company-issued social media account, or serving as a designated
representative at an offline or online event are examples of representing our community.

## Enforcement
Reporting instances of abusive, harassing, or other undesirable behaviour can be done by sending an
email to dmkrishna.agarwal@gmail.com, which will be forwarded to the community leaders in charge 
of enforcement. All complaints will be analysed and thoroughly looked into without delay.

The protection and privacy of the reporter of any incident must be respected by all local officials.
