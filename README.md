## # What is Hacktoberfest? :thinking:
You might have probably landed here because of Hacktoberfest2022. So let us have a go through.

Hacktoberfest is a month-long collaborative initiative managed and organized by [Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and [DEV Community](https://dev.to/) in collaboration with [GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2433-celebrate-open-source-this-october-with-hacktoberfest). It extends from 1st October till 31st October.The initiative was taken into consideration to channelise the essence of [Open Source](https://github.com/open-source) contributions, and to get more developers on-board to build and develop exciting Open Source projects.

The process is easier than it seems!!
All you need to do is to look for good first issues on GitHub and start contributing!!
